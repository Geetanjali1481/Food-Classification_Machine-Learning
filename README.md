# Food-Classification_Machine-Learning
For this project we are trying to classify foods into 4 different categories: "Meats", "Fruits", "Vegetables", and "Dairy/Eggs". The input for the classification will be the nutritional facts of the food products.
The dataset contains food from the USDA database.
